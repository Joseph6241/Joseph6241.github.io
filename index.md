I'm Joseph Becher, a student videographer at Eastern Kentucky University. In this role, I've assisted my senior coworkers with all aspects of production, including writing project proposals/scripts, equipment management, composing/shooting video, audio recording/processing, video editing and effects work. I've also worked as a camera operator for most of the school's live events. This summer, I'll be working in Maine as a part of the videography team at Camp Skylemar.
