Promotional video for a University Study Abroad event. I was one of four people shooting the event, and I was responsible for the entire post-production. As part of the deliverables for this project, I cut together both a one minute long version, as well as a shorter version for some of the universities socials.

Short film that I produced locally. I helped organize the pre-production, handled technical aspects of production, and then completed the post-production, all according to the directors discretion.
