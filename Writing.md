A short script written for class. The assignment had strict guidelines for the script, and after writing it I went on to adapt it for another class where I directed around six people to get it produced.

The first section of a script I'm writing in my freetime. This script is not bound by any rubric, however my goal is to keep it within the realm of what is possible for a small production to create.
