Sample intro graphic I created for work. Created using cell generation, CC Kernel, glow, masking and opacity automation.

The objective for this video was to have a short, vertical video that could loop. The loop was acheived by animating the motion of the frame and the blur to match the motion and focus rack that I shot in production.
